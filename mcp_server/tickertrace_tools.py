"""TickerTrace MCP tools — daily ETF holdings intelligence, 17 tools.

Registers `core/tickertrace.py` onto a shared FastMCP instance, the same way
`registry.py` mounts the momentum tiers.

**Every tool here is `etf_`-prefixed, and that is not cosmetic.** Two of the
underlying names — `get_signals` and `get_sector_flow` — already exist on this
server as TraderMatrix-backed options-flow tools. Same words, completely
different data: `get_sector_flow` is options premium by sector, `etf_sector_flow`
is institutional fund inflows by sector. Registering both unprefixed would have
been a silent collision, and worse, a model picking between them by name would
have no way to tell which dataset it was getting. The prefix also makes
provenance obvious in a tool list, which matters when one source is free and
open and another is paid.

**These are the free tools that a competitor cannot reproduce.** The rest of the
free surface (screeners, technicals, backtests) is code over public data — real
work, but anyone can rewrite it. This is a diff of daily ETF holdings
accumulated since 2026-02, so a fork gets the client and none of the history.
See `core/tickertrace.py` for why that distinction drives the whole free/paid
line.
